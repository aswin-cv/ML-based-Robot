This project focuses on automation using artificial intelligence.
This can be used to overcome/minimize human labour and can be made to perform various tasks in a simple and efficient way. 
The artificial intelligence will perform specified tasks without any human intervention.
The robot performs many tasks like turning on emergency lights during power cuts automatically, following various voice commands given by user, object detection/surveillance, sets alarms and uses GPS and also has Alexa and Google home built in. We have used “Embedded C” as our programming language. 
The components used are Arduino, Relay and a Server (System for management).The main advantages of the system are “It performs task without human interventionand it reduces human efforts" and most importantly it is “automatic”. 
This can be used in Houses, offices, and in Educational Institutions etc.
